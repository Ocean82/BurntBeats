# Deployment Status - Burnt Beats

## Issue Resolution Summary

### Fixed: Connection Refused Error
**Problem**: Production deployment was failing with "connection refused" errors due to port configuration issues.

**Root Cause**: 
- Server was hardcoded to port 5000, conflicting with development server
- Build configuration was creating ESM format but package.json expected CommonJS
- PORT environment variable was not being properly read in production build

### Applied Fixes

1. **Port Configuration**
   - Changed hardcoded port to dynamic: `const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT || '5000', 10)`
   - Updated server to respect PORT environment variable

2. **Build Format Correction**
   - Changed esbuild format from ESM to CommonJS: `--format=cjs --outfile=dist/index.cjs`
   - Fixed package.json script to match: `"start": "node index.cjs"`

3. **Production Configuration**
   - Created optimized production package.json in dist/
   - Added health check script for deployment verification
   - Configured proper dependencies for production

## Deployment Verification

✅ **Server Starts Successfully**
- Production build starts on configured port
- Environment variables properly read
- Database connection established

✅ **Health Check Passes**
- `/health` endpoint responds correctly
- Returns proper JSON status with timestamp and port

✅ **Environment Status**
- Database: Connected
- Stripe: Configured
- Core services: Operational

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build:server

# Test locally
cd dist && PORT=3001 node index.cjs

# Health check
curl http://0.0.0.0:3001/health
```

## Ready for Deployment

The application is now ready for deployment to Replit. The "connection refused" error has been resolved and all core functionality is operational.
